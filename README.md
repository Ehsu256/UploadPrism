# UploadPrism
Browser extension for uploading images and videos from the internet to your PhotoPrism library via context menu.

## How to install
1. Go to [releases](https://github.com/Ehsu256/UploadPrism/releases)
2. Download the .rar or .zip file from the latest release
3. Decompress the downloaded file (you should get folder with various files inside it)
4. In your browser, go to "Manage extensions" menu and enable "Developer mode"
5. Click on the "Load unpacked" that appears after the previous step
6. Select the folder named "extension" from the decompressed file

Alternatively you can clone the repository and load the "extension" folder (which could have more features and changes than the release version), however this comes with a higher risk of having an unstable version with bugs or that may not even work.
